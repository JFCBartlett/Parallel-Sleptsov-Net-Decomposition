# Parallel-Sleptsov-Net-Decomposition
A program used to be able to quickly decompose a Sleptsov net into clans on a CPU using OpenMP to execute in parallel using the spm file format.

This code is based on [ParAd/src/deo.c](https://github.com/dimazaitsev/ParAd/tree/master) and has been modified to run in parallel on a CPU using OpenMP.
